    Thirteen year old Sam Cleary suspects that his mysteriously reclusive
    neighbor Mr. Smith is actually the legendary vigilante Samaritan, who was
    reported dead 20 years ago. With crime on the rise and the city on the brink
    of chaos, Sam makes it his mission to coax his neighbor out of hiding to
    save the city from ruin.
